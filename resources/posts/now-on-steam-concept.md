Finally had enough of Ranger Steve to start posting it places and while I'm completely unsure if this is a good idea,  I'm trying to find good feedback.

Along with this I'm finally asking for pre-game sales for Ranger Steve which will help fund the game assets like new maps, guns, music, and sound effects.
Starting at **$9.97** this price will increase as the game matures.

This is great news because it means I can begin the growing this game's income to pay for it's servers! :)
