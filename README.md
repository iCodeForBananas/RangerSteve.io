# Setup

1. `yarn install` or `npm install`
2. `webpack --config webpack.dll.js`

# Run locally

1. Start the NodeJS server: `npm start`
2. Start webpack: `npm run watch`
3. Use `http://localhost:3001/` to access the app.

Run `npm start` first because it hijacks the port it's supposed to be proxying.
